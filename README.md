## 382 Cryptographhy Application
* Created a Javascript Encryption Application on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/assign03-5duul) using React that allows users to input their own text to be encrypted using the Caesar Encrypt algorithm. 
* This project helped me gain an understanding and appreciation for cryptography and its real world use cases for secure network communications and applications, like Bitcoin. 

As a developer it was beneficial to learn React as it enabled me to build a reactive application that instantly encrypts the userâ€™s text. 

## 281 Project 3 Learning Objectives
* A web API or Application Programming Interface is an API
accessed using the HTTP protocol. Web APIs often deliver data
formatted as JSON.
* A web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript.
The API documentation must first be consulted in order to
understand how the API works and what it returns.
* Use jQuery to post AJAX requests asynchronously
* Use the Postman app to test API requests/responses
* Use NodeJS and Express for a testing server
* Use jQuery, JavaScript, and public APIs to fetch JSON data, then
use it to refresh part of a web page

## 281 Project 2 Learning Objectives
* A web API or Application Programming Interface is an API accessed using the HHTP protocol
* Web APIs often deliver data formatted as JSON
* A web API can be accessed programmatically using JavaScript
* The API documentation must first be consulted in order to understand how the API works and what it returns
* Some web APIs are public, and others require an access key. Flickr offers several public APIs
